# Welcome to Accel!
Accel is my ongoing project object-oriented general purpose compiler project. This is only for educational purposes and will help me learn about compilers and how they actually work.

## Huge thanks to @terrajobst
So far, I've been following his compiler tutorials and they've been the most-helpful. Although I did change some of the code, just because of personal preference. His videos inspired thousands of people to be better developers.



#### Feel free to report any issues or create pull requests. I will be most-thankful.
